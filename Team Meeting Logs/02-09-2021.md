## Recap
Since last week we worked on finishing Milestone 1 and did first parts of lab 3.

## TA Recommendations
Focus on the first two parts of Milestone 2 and possibly the third before the next meeting.
Use next week's meeting to iron out things and finish up, or setup, the last parts of Milestone 2.

## Discussed
- Looked at what is required for Milestone 2.
- Worked on getting Milestone 2 done.
- Discussed key features needed to make it work.
- Decided on 6 basic features to make this viable.
- Started a document for submitting Milestone 2.
- Reviewed current user stories and epics to better align with project.


## Future Week
- Think about what talents we have and what we would be good at developing.
- Work on user stories to use under the key features.
- Figure out Jira more and what chart/board to do for Project Plan and how it works.
- Trade ideas of what order our sprints should be in to discuss and work up by end of next meeting. 
- Finish take-home part of lab 3.
