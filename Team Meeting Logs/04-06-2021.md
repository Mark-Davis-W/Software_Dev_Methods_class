## Recap
Since last week we worked on getting upload file to work and setting up docker to use more things to make the site function with more features. Setting up buckets on S3 to use. Worked on ejs files.

## TA Recommendations
Get things working and ready for presentation. Practice it before giving it.
## Discussed
Talked over how to get variables passed from the main page to the partials in order for it to process depending on the user. Tried to get it working, wasn't successful, currently.
## Future Week
Bring everything together and getting sessions to work in memory and then hopefully in database. Doing the milestone to turn in. Working on project.
