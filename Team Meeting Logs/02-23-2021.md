## Recap

Since last week we worked on timelines a bit and clarifying with Cory about some things.


## TA Recommendations

He previously recommended about using just typed notes forum style but said this time that if we restrict it to just .pdf's that it should be good as well, our original sort of thinking. He helped with clarifying some dates, timelines stuff, and how to organize things in Jira with some helpful hints he found out as well.


## Discussed
- The actual start date for starting of the project starting with getting the pages set up, that we learned in this week's lab, so it is set up for the next steps.
- Organized all the tentative times for each sprint and what is included in them.


## Future Week
Starting to make all the frontend pages for users and admin and login and registration and hopefully have them done by this weekend and meet/check with others to see how things are going.
