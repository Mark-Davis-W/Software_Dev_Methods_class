<h1>TVMaze <a href="https://movie-reviews-api-final.herokuapp.com/" title="Review WebApp")>WebApp</a> Final</h1>

<h3>Overview of Application Architecture:</h3>  

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Movie Review Web App will be hosted with a free tier student account on Heroku. 
  It will use PostgreSQL as the database also on heroku for storing the timestamp and review. 
  I used bootstrap, CSS, and EJS templating for the user interface.</p>


<h3>Project Description:</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can search for a show or movie that is on tvmaze.com and my app uses ajax call in 
  conjunction with the sites response in json formatting, will return the top result, and then allow you to 
  write a review about that fetched result.</p>
  
  <p>This project was for my final grade to demonstrate a simple but fullstack WebApp using the 
  <a href="https://www.tvmaze.com/api" title="TV Maze API")>TVMaze</a> API </p>
