### Project Description: 

\t NoteSquad.com is a CU Network based webpage for students to exchange resources, notes, and find notetakers. This webpage will make it easier for students, especially long-distance/remote learning students, to find notetakers and study material, all in one place.  
\t The students can make a profile which contains their contact information, major, and a list of their current classes. The search feature makes it easier for students to find what theyâ€™re looking for quickly, whether it be a notetaker, note taking jobs, or study material relevant to their current courses and major.
