<h2>The Note Squad</h2>

<h3>Overview of Application Architecture:</h3>  

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NoteSquad.com uses the CU Network Infrastructure to protect access to individual student profiles, which are hosted locally on the students PC. The search function retrieves profile information and documents from a relational database and returns them to the students local profile.</p> 


<h3>Project Description:</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NoteSquad.com is a CU Network based webpage for students to exchange resources, notes, and find notetakers. This webpage will make it easier for students, especially long-distance/remote learning students, to find notetakers and study material, all in one place.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students can make a profile which contains their contact information, major, and a list of their current classes. The search feature makes it easier for students to find what theyâ€™re looking for quickly, whether it be a notetaker, note taking jobs, or study material relevant to their current courses and major.</p>
