<h1>Overview of Application Architecture</h>
><p>NoteSquad.com uses the CU Network Infrastructure to protect access to individual student profiles, which are hosted locally on the students PC. The search function retrieves profile information and documents from a relational database and returns them to the students local profile.</p> 


<h3>Project Description:</h3>

><p>NoteSquad.com is a CU Network based webpage for students to exchange resources, notes, and find notetakers. This webpage will make it easier for students, especially long-distance/remote learning students, to find notetakers and study material, all in one place.</p>

The students can make a profile which contains their contact information, major, and a list of their current classes. The search feature makes it easier for students to find what they’re looking for quickly, whether it be a notetaker, note taking jobs, or study material relevant to their current courses and major.
