## Recap
Since last week we worked on
- learning about postgreSQL and Nodejs.
- talking about how to organize our database.

## TA Recommendations
gave us some sources for how to implement a file system to use with our architecture.
Breaking up Jira a bit into more tasks so it's more manageable.
Made a database diagram suggestion, and let us know how to do it essentially.
Gave us some information about working with Node.js and API.
Said we could use screenshots instead of wireframes if the feature is done.
## Discussed
What we need to get done.
Who is assigned to what tasks and/or who is helping whom with tasks.
## Future Week
Working on getting the last pieces of Milestone 4 for submission.
Starting new sprint for working with database more and how things interact and work together with our new found knowledge of Node.js.
